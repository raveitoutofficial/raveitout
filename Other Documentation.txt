EXTRA STAGE:
Get 90% or more accuracy for a bonus heart.

OVERTIME STAGE:
AKA the One More Extra Stage or Encore Extra Stage in other games.
Get 95% or more accuracy on an extra stage with a glowing red title.
This extra stage is defined in extra1.crs in the song folder, just like regular StepMania.
The Overtime stage is defined in Scripts/config.lua for now.

Mode purposes:
Beginner Mode: 
- Easy songs, all below lv10. Only 3 difficulties per song

Standard Mode:
- Regular play. No W1 judgment.
- 3 Stages normally. Depends on your hearts and if extra hearts is enabled in the operator menu.
- If extra hearts is enabled, you can get up to two bonus hearts.
- Refer to EXTRA STAGE & OVERTIME STAGE

Pro Mode:
- W1 judgment. No differences aside from that.
- EXTRA STAGE & OVERTIME STAGE still obtainable.

Special Mode:
- Used to be called Mod Mode
- Play unique charts in a folder, such as WinDEU Hates You and UKSRT stuff.
- Currently removed in favor of Mission Mode.

Rave Mode:
- Was never implemented, so you can ignore this. Rave songs are available during normal gameplay.
- Pick one song and play it.
 - Song is a remix from the original song list.
 - Song is a full version (5+ minutes)
- Any song that is passed becomes unlocked for Arcade mode.
 - Full version and cut version are both unlocked.

Mixtape Mode:
- Play courses. Hurr.
- Removed because the code was impossible to maintain.

Mission Mode:
- Like DJMax Respect's mission mode. Exactly the same, in fact.
- Unique quest mode exclusive charts and songs are in this mode, because they don't
  meet the criteria for being in RIO normally.
- Unlock cool titles for beating this mode, I guess?

EASTER EGGS:
Within 4 days before or after valentines day: Hearts in background
December: snowflakes in background, christmas hats.
Weed combo: 420 combos.
