Rave It Out uses its own structure for songs, so read carefully.

The standard structure of a song is something like:
/Songs/02-EDM/Shelter/
	Shelter.ogg (Audio)
	Shelter.ssc (Stepfile)
	Shelter-banner.png (Banner)
	jacket.png (Jacket)
	Shelter-background.png (Background)

However, in RIO things are different.
Note: A directory starting with a "/" means the root of the stepmania directory, usually containing Songs, Data, Logs, Scripts, Cache, Themes, etc

An example of a RIO song with everything self contained:
/Songs/02-EDM/Shelter/
	Shelter.ogg (Audio)
	Shelter.ssc (Stepfile)
	jacket.png (Jacket, 300x300)
	largejk.png (High resolution jacket for ScreenStageInformation)
	Shelter-background.png (Background)
	preview.mpg (PreviewVid)
	Video.mpg (BGA)
	msg.txt (Random tidbits shown during ScreenStageInformation)
	specialBG.png
	
An example of a RIO song where everything is spread out everywhere:
/Songs/02-EDM/Shelter/
	Shelter.ogg (Audio)
	Shelter.ssc (Stepfile)
	jacket.png (Jacket, 300x300)
	msg.txt
/SongJacketsLarge/Shelter.png (High resolution jacket)
/SongBackgrounds/HD/Shelter-bg.png (Widescreen Background)
/SongBackgrounds/SD/Shelter (SD)-bg.png (non widescreen background)
/SongPreviews/Shelter-preview.mpg (PreviewVid)
/SongMovies/EDM001-Shelter.mpg (BGA)


BANNERS:
Rave it out does not use Banners at all (although our dev team refers to jackets as banners for some reason). The theme will search for jacket then banner using standard StepMania functions.

JACKETS: RIO uses two jackets, an SD and an HD one.
For the SD jacket:
- Refer to BANNERS. Jackets are 300x300 usually.
For the HD jacket:
- If you are putting it in the song folder, it must be named "largejk.png".
- If you are putting it in the /SongJacketsLarge folder, it must be named after the name of the folder and have the png extension.

PREVIEWVID:
Fill out the #PREVIEWVID tag in the .ssc of your song. It will search the song folder, then the /SongPreviews folder.
There is no standardized naming scheme currently.

BACKGROUND:
The theme will search /SongBackgrounds/HD/ if using widescreen, else it will search /SongBackgrounds/SD/.
HD backgrounds MUST be named after the song folder and have "-bg.png" at the end.
SD backgrounds MUST be named after the song folder and have " (SD)-bg.png" at the end.
If an HD/SD background is not found (Depending on your aspect ratio), the standard background in the #BACKGROUND tag of the .ssc will be checked using standard StepMania functions.

LOADING SCREEN BACKGROUND:
If you have a specialBG.png inside your song folder, it will show if you got >=90 accuracy.

SONGMOVIES:
*This is not implemented, ignore it.
Just like StepMania, first the song folder will be checked then /SongMovies/ will be checked. However, the filename of your movie can have an optional "(HD)" at the end (Ex. Gangnam Style (HD).mp4", along with an optional second video in /SongMovies/SD/ for the SD video. If you have an HD and SD video, the one that matches your aspect ratio will be picked.

SONG MESSAGE:
You can display a custom message that tells information about the song during ScreenStageInformation if you put msg.txt in the song folder.
If you want it to pick from multiple messages, simply put them on a separate line and it will randomly pick one.
Note: msg.txt MUST be "CR LF" formatted, aka Windows style. If you don't know what that means, you're probably using Windows anyway and you don't need to worry.

YEAR:
Put the year in the #ORIGIN tag of your ssc for it to show up in the song select.

DESCRIPTION:
Put something in the description tag of the steps for it to show under that difficulty in the music select.

LEVEL:
Songs at lv99 or more will show up as "??".

FORCED NOTESKINS:
Use the #NOTESKINS tag to force a noteskin for that chart. Multiple forced noteskins does not work currently.

STEPS INFO:
The top line is the chart author, which is the #CREDIT tag in your ssc.
Put something in the #CHARTNAME tag for your steps if you want it to display something custom for the bottom line.
It will also show instead of the regular "SINGLE Lv.XX" in the results screen.

HEARTS:
By default it will subtract 1 heart if it's under 95 seconds, 2 hearts for that until long, 4 hearts for long, 6 for marathon.
These are stepmania defaults (Except shortcut) so you can edit it in preferences.ini under LongVerSongSeconds and MarathonVerSongSeconds
If you want to manually set the heart count, add a #SONGTYPE tag to the ssc:
- #SONGTYPE:ARCADE; for regular (2 Hearts, usually 2-2:30)
- #SONGTYPE:SHORTCUT; for short (1 Heart, usually 1:00-1:30)
- #SONGTYPE:REMIX; for longer (3 Hearts, 2:30+)
- #SONGTYPE:FULLSONG; for extra-long (4 Hearts, usually ~4:00)
- #SONGTYPE:MARATHON; for very very long (6 Hearts, usually >=6:00)
